# KeyTracker
Tracks key presses for FFR, StepMania, or any other 4 key game.

# SETUP

Open the config.txt file in the KeyTracker folder, and fill in the desired settings.

For setting the key mapping, all alphanumerical characters are accepted, as well as the numpad and arrow keys. For numpad keys, please enter NUM# for the desired numpad number (eg. NUM1 for numpad 1). For arrow keys, enter one of LEFT, DOWN, UP, or RIGHT.

## Settings

Left - the key you press for hitting the left arrow

Down - the key you press for hitting the down arrow

Up - the key you press for hitting the up arrow

Right - the key you press for hitting the right arrow

Overlay - set to true if you want the window to appear on top of all your other windows. Set it to false otherwise.

# USAGE

To start and stop the tracker, press CTRL + R. The red bar should turn green, and the timer should start counting up when you start tracking.

## What do these stats mean?

**KPS** means how many keys you pressed in the last second, while **Peak** means the highest KPS you've achieved during the current session. The rest should be straightforward.
